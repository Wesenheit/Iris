# Iris
Python library based on [pyphot](https://mfouesneau.github.io/pyphot/), [pystellibs](https://mfouesneau.github.io/pystellibs/),
[astroquery](https://astroquery.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and [emcee](https://emcee.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) designed to easly prepare SED of objects.
It was developed during my time at Warsaw University and used it in my Bsc thesis. Simple use cases can be found in test directory.
